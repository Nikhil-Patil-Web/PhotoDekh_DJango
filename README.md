# PhotoDekh_DJango
The following is a website using DJango. I have earlier made it using MERN but I have used a different tech stack for this one. 

Earlier I made the similar website based on the MERN stack. But as an individual in info tech, we need to keep moving to tools which are more efficient and which are opening a new space in the market.
Based on those lines, I have decided to learn this tech skill via this project. 
It is a photo sharing website. 
The front end is essentially created using JS, HTML and CSS.
